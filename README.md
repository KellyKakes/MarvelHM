# CSS Selection and Styles Character Build

TODO: Write a project description

## Installation

Choose characters from a comic, movie or TV series. Use the Marvel class build; replace the
existing logo with one that matches your selection. Update the colours throughout (the header
background colour, the red bumper bars, text colour etc)

Choose a different theme for the page - different background images, etc. Make it your own.
You can use the same classes and IDs as the class build, but change the colour values etc -
explore whatâ€™s possible with CSS.

Update the Marvel Characters Photoshop sprite sheet, re-export it and use it on the page
for your main character images.

Update 2 of the lightboxes to show more content on click; the background image in each of
those lightboxes should be different.

 You might need to change the layout of the text and
images in the lightbox - explore how to do this with margins, padding, floats etc.
The text content in the lightbox can remain placeholder-only (lorem ipsum).

Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as
demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.
